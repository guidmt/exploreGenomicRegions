Welcome to the manual page of exploreGenomicRegions *Author: malagoli@ingm.org * An important step of the analysis of ChIP-seq data is the integration of several genomics regions. Several tools are available for the visualization of data genome-wide. However there is a lack of tools able to aggregate and integrate bed files from ChIP-seq and others omics-data and extract relevant biological information. The main aim of this project is which to develop a novel tool for the visualization of omics- data. Characteristics R-implementation scripts for the visualization and the extraction of subset of data script for the integration of omics data (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNAse) the scripts are also available on https://github.com/guidmt NEWS 23/10/2015: Today is born exploreGenomicRegions!!
